# StarCCM-SLURM-Submission
StarCCM+ Design Manager submission for cluster with SLURM job scheduler. 
This project is currently a work in progress. 

This design manager submission is a "General Job Submission" as per the Star-CCM+ manual. If you would
like to use a pre-allocation job submission visit: "REPO Work in Progress"


The current version supported is V18.02.2018-R8, although other versions may work. This submission
is designed to work with our cluster, so minor changes may need to be made for other clusters with
other job schedulers (PBS, SLURM, etc) or different Star-CCM+ configurations (MPI, etc)
